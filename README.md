### Congruences
* Theorem 1.3.5, states that 𝒂𝒙 ≡ 𝒃 (mod 𝒏) has a solution if an only if gcd(𝒂, 𝒏) is a divisor of 𝒃.
* Eg. 42𝒙 ≡ 12 (mod 90) is equivalent to solving the equation 42𝒙 = 12 + 90𝒒 for integers and 𝒒

### Euclidean Algorithm
gcd(10, 102) = greatest common divisor of the numbers provided. Also known as the greatest common factor or the largest prime number that divides both/all the numbers provided in the function. The algorithm goes:If either a or b is zero the other number is the gcd of those numbers in accordance with A = B\*Q + R - the algorithm executes those instructions until that condition is met:
```
gcd( 1050, 108 )
Dividing 1050 and 108 is 9 with a remainder of 78.
= 1050 = 108 * 9 + 78
gcd ( 108, 78 )
= 108 = 78 * 1 + 30
gcd ( 78, 30 )
= 78 = 30 * 2 + 18;
gcd( 30, 18 )
= 30 = 18 * 1 + 12;
gcd ( 18, 12 )
= 18 = 12 * 1 + 6;
gcd ( 12, 6 )
= 12 = 6 * 2 + 0;
The remainder is 0 of gcd(12, 6) = gcd(6, 0);
THEREFORE:
gcd(1050, 108) = 6 = 1050x + 108y
1050x + 108y = 6
```
gcd (*ka, kb*) = *k* gcd (*a,b*).
- gcd (ka, kb) = k gcd (a, b)
